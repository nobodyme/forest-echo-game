## Vibe coding

Experimented Vibe coding with various tools like Claude, HAI build and Cursor

So far, the only change that required a developer perspective was asking it to split the functionalities in different files. Prior to this, even though the prior solution worked, everything was in a single file and quickly became too large to fit inside the context window and it struggled to make a change to the file since, it couldn't read all at once.
Now it's back to working ways again.

Let's see how far can we push it?
